# Snake - Godot 4.1 - GDScript2
# Version 1.0: 11/10/23
  # Barebones functional snake game in 3D
  # Main Menu, Options Menu, and Classic mode
  # Current Bugs:
    # Food can still spawn inside of snake tail and inside itself.
      # This doesn't really break game behaviour, but maybe that's just because I'm not that good at snake.
    # Snake tail is designed to delete from end to head one by one, currently broken. 
      # Bandaid applied, tail currently deletes all at once.
    # Snake logic appears to handle eating 2 food at once, but I am not convinced, need to evaluate.
  # Upcoming Updates:
    # Tying game to a web page and Github hosting 
    # Code clean-up in immutable snake behaviour and classic game mode.
      # These will become the template for further game modes.
    # Bug fixing and evaluation of snake handling additional food.
      # Determining if this is being handled will clarify some behaviour I intend to capitilize on in different game modes.
    # Fleshing out of menu components.
      # "Tutorial" boxes to explain controls and goal of the game.
      # Hide mouse on begin game. Show on game end or pause.
# First Update:
